# IDE/Editor setup' suggestions

Use your favorite IDE/Editor.

## Editing `.ffizer.yaml`

- add support for yaml files
- if possible configure to use [schemastore json](https://www.schemastore.org/json/)
  to validate, to provide "auto completion" and tool tips
- if your yaml plugin is not compatible with schemastore but it accepts json schema
  to validate yaml you can configure it to use the online schema

  ```json
    "yaml.schemas": {
      ...
      "https://ffizer.github.io/ffizer/ffizer.schema.json": [".ffizer.yaml"],
    },
  ```

  or to use a local file that can be generated by

  ```sh
  ffizer show-json-schema
  ```

By example, for Visual Studio Code, you can use the following extension/plugin:

```yaml
Name: YAML
Id: redhat.vscode-yaml
Description: YAML Language Support by Red Hat, with built-in Kubernetes syntax support
Publisher: redhat
VS Marketplace Link: https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml
```
